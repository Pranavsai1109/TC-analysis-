# Telcom Churn Analysis
A data-driven project focused on understanding why telecom customers leave (churn) and identifying key business insights to reduce customer attrition.

##  Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior using telecom data and discover patterns that help predict churn. Based on these findings, strategic recommendations are proposed to improve customer retention.

## Executive Summary

- **Churn Rate**: ~26.5% of customers have churned.
- **High Churn Risk**: Senior citizens, month-to-month contract holders, new users (tenure < 3 months), and electronic check users.
- **Low Churn Indicators**: Customers with longer contracts and those who use services like Phone, DSL, and Online Security are more loyal.

### Key Recommendations

- Promote **long-term contracts** with discounts.
- Bundle essential services (like Online Security) to increase retention.
- Launch early engagement programs for new users.
- Encourage **digital payments** over electronic checks.

## Tools & Technologies Used

**Python**
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
**Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory data analysis
**CSV Data**: Customer churn dataset

## Conclusion
This analysis provides clear evidence that customer churn is influenced by contract type, service usage, payment method, and customer tenure. By focusing on high-risk groups such as senior citizens, new users, and electronic check payers, telecom companies can develop targeted retention strategies.
Implementing long-term contract incentives, bundling essential services, and improving the early customer experience can significantly reduce churn and boost customer lifetime value. This project lays the groundwork for more advanced predictive modeling and real-time churn prevention systems.
